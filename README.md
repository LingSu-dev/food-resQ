# What it does

Our app uses a database to store our user's fridge and keeps track of the food in their fridge. When the user wants a food recipe recommendation our app will help our user finish off their food waste. Using the power of chatGPT our app is super flexable and all the unknown food and food that you are too lazy to measure the weight of can be quickly put into a flexible and delicious recipe. 

# How we built it

Using figma for design, react.JS bootstrap for frontend, flask backend, a mongoDB database, and openAI APIs we were able to create this stunning looking demo.
